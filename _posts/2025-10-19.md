title: "AI/ML IN COMPUTER VISION AND APPLICATIONS"
date: 2025-10-19
Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) have become integral to the rapid advancements in Computer Vision (CV), 
enabling machines to perceive, analyze, and interpret visual information with human-like accuracy. From traditional image processing to deep learning-based architectures such as 
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and the emerging Vision Transformers (ViTs), AI/ML has significantly expanded the scope of computer vision applications.
These advancements have led to breakthroughs in healthcare diagnostics, autonomous driving, security and surveillance, agriculture, and industrial automation. 
Despite these achievements, challenges such as high computational requirements, data dependency, model interpretability, and ethical concerns remain critical research issues. 
This paper presents a comprehensive overview of AI/ML techniques in computer vision, highlighting their applications, comparative strengths (CNN vs. ViT), limitations, and future research directions. 
The study emphasizes the growing importance of explainable AI (XAI) to enhance trust, transparency, and reliability in computer vision systems.
